Sample problem

1. Palindromic Substring
Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring.
For example, given the string "babad",
the output should be "bab" or "aba".

2. Fibonacci Number
Write a program that takes an input number n
and outputs the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
For example, if n is 6, the program should output 8
(since the 6th Fibonacci number is 8).

3. Counting Pairs
Given an array of integers, count the number 
of pairs of integers that have a difference of k.
For example, given the array [1, 7, 5, 9, 2, 12, 3]
and k = 2, the output should be 4
(since there are 4 pairs with a difference of 2: 
(1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), and (7, 9)).

4. Maximum Subarray Sum
Given an array of integers,
find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
For example, given the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4],
the output should be 6 (which corresponds to the sum
of the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1]).

5. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an array of integers,
find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
For example, given the array [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
the output should be 4 (since the longest increasing
subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101]).
